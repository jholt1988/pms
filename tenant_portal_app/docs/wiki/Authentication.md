# Authentication

The Property Management Suite application has a robust authentication system that supports two user roles: `TENANT` and `PROPERTY_MANAGER`.

## Signing Up

To create a new account, click on the "Sign Up" link on the login page. You will be prompted to enter a username and password. After you submit the form, a new user account will be created for you with the `TENANT` role.

## Logging In

To log in to the application, enter your username and password on the login page and click "Sign In". If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to the main application page.

## Roles

*   **TENANT:** Tenants have access to features such as submitting maintenance requests, viewing their lease and payment history, and communicating with property managers.
*   **PROPERTY_MANAGER:** Property managers have access to all tenant features, as well as features for managing properties, leases, rental applications, and expenses.
